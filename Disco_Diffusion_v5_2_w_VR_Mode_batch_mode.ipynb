    "Original notebook by Katherine Crowson (https://github.com/crowsonkb, https://twitter.com/RiversHaveWings). It uses either OpenAI's 256x256 unconditional ImageNet or Katherine Crowson's fine-tuned 512x512 diffusion model (https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion), together with CLIP (https://github.com/openai/CLIP) to connect text prompts with images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified by Daniel Russell (https://github.com/russelldc, https://twitter.com/danielrussruss) to include (hopefully) optimal params for quick generations in 15-100 timesteps rather than 1000, as well as more robust augmentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further improvements from Dango233 and nsheppard helped improve the quality of diffusion in general, and especially so for shorter runs like this notebook aims to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vark added code to load in multiple Clip models at once, which all prompts are evaluated against, which may greatly improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest zoom, pan, rotation, and keyframes features were taken from Chigozie Nri's VQGAN Zoom Notebook (https://github.com/chigozienri, https://twitter.com/chigozienri)\n",

    "3D animation implementation added by Adam Letts (https://twitter.com/gandamu_ml) in collaboration with Somnai. Creation of disco.py and ongoing maintenance.\n",
